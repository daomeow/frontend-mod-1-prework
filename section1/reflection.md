## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
```
How important it is to continue and view learning as a lifelong process. I really enjoy reading and listening to NPR podcasts, this helps me stay up to date with current events. I'm also looking forward to doing more driver and navigator assignments with peers.
```
2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
```
* String: used to represent text
* Integer/Float: handles all numbers, whole or contains decimal point
* Boolan: evaluates a value as true or false
```
3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
```
console.log('"Hello World"')
```
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
```
You would use "//" to write comments to further explain what code just wrote. It is easier to pick up others' codes and know what they have done with good comments.
```
5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
```
A variables will store something that you are able to reuse and reference to the end of time.
```
6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
```
NPR has a dropdown menu for their news, music, shows and podcasts, ect. When the user selects a different location of their website, different variables will be referenced to pull the current layout of that section. For example world news will reference variables for what color the banner is, hyperlinks to current articles, locoations of ads NPR has relationships with, ect.
```

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
```
Concatenation will be used in JavaScript to join multiple stings together using +
```
8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
```
GMail will use concatention when the user signs in, a unique dynamic URL is used to pull the specifics user's inbox.
```
9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
```
N/A
```
