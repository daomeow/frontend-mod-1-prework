## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
```
I've never physically timed myself but I definitely agree that the act to physically set a clock, make check marks
for completed timed sessions and to check boxes with completed to-do items was very satisfying. I felt more energized
during section 4 following the Pomodoro technique, which was perfect for the hardest section of this prework.
```
1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
```
I tried to estimate timed goals with a lot of debugging in mind. Some exercises I finished close to the goal and
other times it took me a lot longer to find additional resources online. I found myself more focused when I applied
Pomodoro's technique.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
```
Both an array and object are used to store data but an object will store more complexed data and can be accessed
through a string. Where as an array you can print the index's position or print the whole array (not having the
ability to manipulate the stored data with new values).  
```

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  ```
  Array, list of multiple items in a variable  
  ```
  * List of states and their capitals
  ```
  Object, capitals are properties of states
  ```
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  ```
  Array, list of multiple items in a variable
  ```
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  ```
  Array, this is a list
  ```
  * List of student names and their cohort
  ```
  Object, cohort is a property of the students
  ```
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  ```
  Object, the cake ingredient and their amount is a property to cake
  ```
  * All my favorite restaurants
  ```
  Array, list of favorite restaurants would fall until a single variable
  ```

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
```
Amazon would display what is in your virtual cart. Keys and values would be the item type (weighted blanket)
and the price of what's in your cart.
```

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
```
Section 4 was by far the hardest and I think I made myself more confused with placement of the curlybrackets
and semicolons. What threw me off was in the functions section where it mentioned the semicolon going after
the argument and not the last curlybracket.. 
```
