## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
A growth mindset behavior would include continuous practice, perseverance, and the ability to accept critical feedback.
It has to be a lifestyle to thrive off pushing beyond one's current understanding.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I definitely believe that failing is learning - debugging will be frustrating at times but to overcome that speed bump will be valuable. I need to set more manageable goals to keep up momentum and be more open to feedback, for example posting prework progress on time

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
An example of where an NPR developer would use an array would be their list of shows and podcasts that they provide from their website.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
It's a way to manipulate an array, JavaScript has several built in. It makes it easier for the user to add/remove items, and even search within the array. I have used an array's length property the most in this section. It is such a useful tool to use when referencing an array and not knowing the actual length/how many times the loop needs to run.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
Loops are used to run blocks of code repeatedly. Loops are very useful with arrays so that the code doesn't need written out multiple times to reference all the indexes within the array. For loops are when you need to run code for a specific number of times. While and do while loops are used when you don't know how many times the code needs to run.    

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
A loop will continuously run until it comes across a condition, that you have set, where it doesn't meet expectations. Loops can help you count a certain number of situations or repeat a statement multiple times.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
N/A
