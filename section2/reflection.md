## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
```
The first article made a great point to be stuck for 20 minutes until you ask your question. Personally, I feel
alright about asking questions but not until after I've banged my head on it for a while (sometimes
accidentally spend more than 20 minutes). Another point made that stuck with me was about timing. If that issue
doesn't completely stop progress question, continue to work on other parts until it's the right time to ask.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
```
The node function was easy to reference from the section 1 notes. I have also ran some of my code in chrome's console
if I happen to be on that window. I really enjoyed Part C's, **Functions**, layout in section 2 of pre work. It was
very useful to read out of the textbook, see a tutorial and read a blog post to learn about functions. The material
was easier to understand and absorbed when it was laid out in differently.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
```
A conditional statement is used to evaluate if it is either true or false. For example, did I drink coffee this
morning? A conditional web application example would be, did the user click on the home icon? If so, trigger the block
of code to update the website to the home screen would be activated
```

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
```
if statements are in search of a truthy condition. If the first statement isn't true, JavaScript will move down to the
next if statement created with **else if**. If all the statements are false *else* command will execute the intended
action.
```

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
```
If/else can be used to compare one or multiple conditions within a block of code. Comparison operators will determine
the equality or difference between values or variables. Logical operators would include && and ||. && will only return
true when both conditions are true and || will only return false when either are false.
```
1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
```
N/A
```
